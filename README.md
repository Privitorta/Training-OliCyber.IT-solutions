Lazy CTF solutions for the [OliCyber.IT](https://training.olicyber.it/challenges) training platform, by Emma with love. ðŸŒ¼

Try not to abuse this repository, challenge yourself first, and come here only if youâ€™re truly desperate ;)

## More information
The [OliCyber.IT](https://training.olicyber.it/challenges) training platform offers a great amount of Capture-The-Flag challenges to solve. You only need to register an account to try them out, it's completely **free**. In this repository, I have collected (almost) every solution I used to solve various challenges. Its purpose is to keep them archived and make them useful for everyone.

## Updates
The repository is constantly updated, it's not complete. I solve and upload CTF solutions overtime; come back every once in a while if you can't find some.
